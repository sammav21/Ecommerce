Plan
1. Style home, products, product, and cart pages (using dummy hardcoded data)
2. Connect sanity db to code to fill in item info
    2a. Fetch data from api library igdb???
3. Create 'add to cart' logic/functionality 
    3a. Without much thought, at the moment it seems I will create a new table in sanity db that will hold array of products. I can add/delete from it (1 cart has many products)
4. Create 'checkout' logic/functionality 
    4a. Add success page.
5. Depending on how long 1-4 takes, asseess if I leave it there or move on?
6. Create and style account page/liked items page 
7. Add 'sign in/sign out' functionality
    7a. Next-auth (google, github, etc. or JWT?)
8. Add 'like item' logic/functionality 
9. Take account data and add to checkout process to prefill
